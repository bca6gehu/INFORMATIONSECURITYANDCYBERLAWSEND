answer2:
your computer faces different threats whenever you browse the 
web, including viruses, malware and spyware. the good news is 
your web browser has a lot of built-in security features to help protect
your computer. 
the three security aspects of browser are:
1- check the web address: malicious websites often use deceptive 
web addresses to trick users. for example, wellfargo.com looks 
similar to wellsfargo.com but it is missing the s in the middle.
double checking the domain name is a good way to ensure you are
going to the reak, trusted site- not a phony site with a similar web address.
Some web browsers will even try to make the domain name easier to read.

2- Look at the security symbol
Some websites will display a lock symbol in the address bar. 
This is most commonly seen with certain types of websites,
 like online stores and banking sites.
 This means the website is using an HTTPS connection, which 
makes it safe to enter your personal information. You'll also see
 https at the beginning of the URL.
You won't see this symbol on all websites, and that's OKâ€”
not all websites need this extra layer of security. However, you 
should avoid entering any sensitive information, such as your
 credit card number, if you don't see this symbol in the address
 bar.

3- Update your browser regularly
New viruses and malware are created all the time, so it's
 important to update your browser regularly. Your browser will 
usually notify you when it has an update available, but you
 always have the option to update manually. In this example, 
we're updating Google Chrome to the most recent version, 
but the exact update procedure will vary depending on your
 browser.
